# Automated Maintenance Request Processing System

**Situation:** Maintenance Service Orders were submitted manually on paper, making it difficult to track, monitor, and analyze requests.

**Task:** Replace the manual process with a digital solution that enables traceability and monitoring.

**Action:** Designed Excel-based forms integrated with Python automation, which register the requests and generated standardized Service Order documents automatically. These documents were sent to be printed in both the Managerâ€™s and Maintenance offices.

**Result:** Fully digitized the request process, reducing processing time and enabling monitoring and reporting of maintenance requests.


## How It Works

### File Watcher Script (watchdog.py)

- Monitors Excel file for changes with timestamp tracking
- A VBA script register it and saves the file when a new requests is created on Excel
- When the modified timestammp of the Excel file changes, that will automatically trigger the 'service_order_processor.py' script

###  Maintenance Request Processor (service_order_processor.py)

- Reads maintenance requests from Excel spreadsheet
- Generates formatted Word documents from template
- Inserts digital signatures and request data automatically
- Prints documents to multiple network printers
- Sends authorization emails for improvement requests via Outlook
- Tracks processed requests to avoid duplicates
- Includes comprehensive error handling and logging

### Key Features:

- File monitoring with modification timestamp detection
- Automated document generation using python-docx
- Multi-printer support
- Digital signature insertion from image files
- Text formatting and wrapping for document templates
- Excel data validation and processing
